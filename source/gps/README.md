We built upon the GPS version as given by Li and Malik [[1]](#1)
The original GPS code of Li and Malik can be found at [https://www.math.ias.edu/~ke.li/downloads/lto_code.tar.gz](https://www.math.ias.edu/~ke.li/downloads/lto_code.tar.gz)

In a nutshell, we modified the GPS code to be able to continuously sample from the starting teacher. To this end we introduce a sampling rate that determines how often we use new samples generated from the starting policy.
